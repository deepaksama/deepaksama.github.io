Spring Framework

Container Overview:
The org.springframework.contex.ApplicationContext represents the sprring IoC container.
Spring IoC container is responsibel for intantiating, configuring and assembling a forementioned beans.
The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate by reading configuration metadata.
This configuration metadata can be represented in 

	XML
	Java Annotations,
	or Java code

Configuration metadata	

Spring IoC Container is totally decoupled from the format in which configuration metadata is written.
It is supplied in three forms
* XML-based configuration
* Annotation-based configuration
* Java-based configuration

XML-based configuration
XML-based configuration shows these beans configured as <bean> elements inside toplevel <beans> element.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

</beans>
