	- Address the people with respect to the relationship

			- Once you are aquented with person you can say  Hello/Dear sussan ( drop Mrs)
3. Being too informal
	- If you are writing to your client whom you know from a month does not mean that we can write in very informal way. ( Ex: Hey Johni)
	- Avoid nicknames/endearments
	
4. Forgetting the subject
	- This is considered very crude and rude and very careless 
	- It should tell what the email is about.  
	- It should be crisp and clear.
	- It should be somthing like "Regarding the quarterly presentation"
	
5. Hitting reply all
	- Would irritate/disterb/oversharing with others.
	
6. Not punctuating
	- punctuations like commas, fullstops, semicolons, if not used in properplace would change the meaning of the sentence.
	-
7. Including too many personal details
	- Do not include too many personal details noone is cared about.
	- Keep it breif , to the point and formal
	
8. Not correcting typos/errors
	- Errors tend to happen correct them
	- Read the mail twice and review the content before sending it and correct spelling, punctuations, and details.

9. Repeating questions
	- If you are not satisfied with the answer provided then you can always say 
		"Well I am glad that you addressed my query, but I am still not clear. Can I request you to clarify?".  But do not repeat the same questions all over again.  That would be considered rude.

10. Do not use Emojis
