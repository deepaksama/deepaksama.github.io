	DevOps ( Development and Operations)
	--------------------------------------
		Its paractice of opearations and development engineers participating together in entire service lifecycle, 
		from design through the development process to production support.
		
		DevOps replaces the model where one teams writes the code and another team tests it and another team deploys it and another team operates it.
		
		In old way of delivering software, most of the time is spent in development is built and it is deployed and submit it for test phase at the end.
		Which get the bug report in large batches late in the project.
		
		In Continuous delivery every code commit on your application code is build automatically. 
		Unit tests are run and application is deployed in production like environment.
		Also automated acceptence tests are run and changes are passed or failed in minutes after code is checkedin.
		Code is always in working state with continuous delivery.
		
		Continuous Integration
		----------------------
			Is practice of automatically building and unit testing the entire application ideally on each code check-in.
			
		Continuous Delivery
		-------------------
			Is a practice of deploying every change to a production like environment and performing automated integration and acceptence testing.
			
		Continuous Deployment
		-----------------------
			Every change that goes through full enough automated testing is deployed automatically to production.
			
		
		Benefit:
		--------
			Huge decrease in time to market the product.
			Increase in Quality
			Continuous delivery limits your work in progress
			Improves mean time to recover


	Spring Framework for JMS
	--------------------------

	Message :
	--------
				Its data that is meaningful between two applications which use it.  
		Messages are used to transfer information from one application to another which may not be running in same platform.

	What is messaging :
	------------------
			Messaging is communication between two components or applications ( in distributed environment)
			which are loosly coupled unlike its peers like TCP sockets, CORBA or RMI.  Often between dissimilar systems or written in different programming languages.
			
			
	Advantages of messaging:
	-----------------------
		Ability to integrate different platforms.
		Asynchronous message.
		Reliability of message delivery.
		increases the scalability.
		
	JMS:(Java Message Service:
	--------------------------
		JMS is Message Oriented  Middleware (MOM) API for sending and receiving messages between two or more clients. 
		JMS is part of the Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)
		Using JMS programmer can invoke messaging services of different Message Brokers like ActiveMQ, MQSeries, SonicMQ.
		JMS supports messages that contain Serialized Java Objects and also XML.
		
	Components of JMS:
	------------------
		JMS Provider
		JMS Client
			JMS Producer/Publisher:
			JMS Consumer/Subscriber:
		
		
	MOM Providers:
	--------------
		WebLogic	- 	Oracle 
		MQSeries	-	IBM
		JBossMQ		-	JBoss
		SonicMQ		-	Progress
		TIBCO EMS	-	TIBCO
		ActiveMQ	-	Apache
		

	Messaging Models:
	-----------------
		There are two messesging models:
		1. Point to Point
			Built around the concept Message queues. Each message has only one consumer. We might have more than one sender and more than one receiver, 
			but only one receiver may consume any message.
		
		
		2. Publisher/Subscriber
				- Durable/Persistent
				- NonDurable/Non-Persistent

			Built around the concept topics. Each message has multiple consumers. 
			Each message published to topic is broadcast to all clients that subscribed to the topic.
			
	Programmer Model:
	-----------------
			ConnectionFactory --> Connection --> Session --> Message Producer/Subscriber
