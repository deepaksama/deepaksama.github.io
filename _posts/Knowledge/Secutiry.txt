What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
	Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.
	
	Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.

Best Practices
---------------

Let’s note down some important points while designing security for your RESTful web services.

* Use only HTTPS protocol so that your whole communocation is always encrypted.
* Never send auth credentials or API keys as query param. They appear in URL and can be logged or tracked easily.
* Use hardest encryption level always. It will help in having more confidence.
* For resources exposed by RESTful web services, it’s important to make sure any PUT, POST, and DELETE request is protected from Cross Site Request Forgery.
* Always validate the input data asap it is recieved in server method. Use only primitive data as input parameter as much as possible.
* Rely on framework provided validation features as they are tested by large community already.
* Let me know your thoughts and experiences on securing RESTful web services in your organization.
