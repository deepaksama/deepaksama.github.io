Network:
	A set of devices often mentioned as nodes connected by media link is called a Network.
	A "node" can be a device which is capable of sending or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network like a computer, printer etc. The links connecting the devices are called "Communication channels".

	A network must be able meet certain criteria.
	* Performance
	* Reliabiliy
	* Scalability
	
Data Communication
	Exchange of data between two devices through a transmission medium is called Data communication.
The data is exchanged in the 0's and 1's form. Trasmission medium used is wire cable.

Components of Data communication:
	* Sender - One who sends the message.
	* Medium - Through which the data/message is sent. Ex: modem
	* Protocol - Rules that govern the data communication.
	* Receiver - To whom the data is delivered
	* Message - Information to be delivered

---------------------------------------
	There are two ways to connect two devices
		* Point-to-Point connection
		* Multipoint communication

There are four types of topologies:
1. Bus topology
2. Star topology
3. Ring topology
4. Mesh topology
