	DevOps ( Development and Operations)
	--------------------------------------
		Its paractice of opearations and development engineers participating together in entire service lifecycle, 
		from design through the development process to production support.
		
		DevOps replaces the model where one teams writes the code and another team tests it and another team deploys it and another team operates it.
		
		In old way of delivering software, most of the time is spent in development is built and it is deployed and submit it for test phase at the end.
		Which get the bug report in large batches late in the project.
		
		In Continuous delivery every code commit on your application code is build automatically. 
		Unit tests are run and application is deployed in production like environment.
		Also automated acceptence tests are run and changes are passed or failed in minutes after code is checkedin.
		Code is always in working state with continuous delivery.
		
		Continuous Integration
		----------------------
			Is practice of automatically building and unit testing the entire application ideally on each code check-in.
			
		Continuous Delivery
		-------------------
			Is a practice of deploying every change to a production like environment and performing automated integration and acceptence testing.
			
		Continuous Deployment
		-----------------------
			Every change that goes through full enough automated testing is deployed automatically to production.
			
		
		Benefit:
		--------
			Huge decrease in time to market the product.
			Increase in Quality
			Continuous delivery limits your work in progress
			Improves mean time to recover
