### **Intent**

Alows and object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its type.

### **Applicability**

Use the State Pattern in either of the following cases:
* An object's behaviour dependent on its state and it must change its behaviour at runtime depending on that state.
* Objects have large multi-part conditional statements that depend on the object's state.  The State pattern puts each branch of the conditional in a seperate class.

### **Consequences**

State pattern has following consequences:

* As all the state specific behaviour is lives in a State subclass:
	* It localizes state specific behaviour.
	* New states and transitions can be added easily by defining new subclass.
* As state transitions are atomic (happen by rebinding one variable, not several) from the Context perspective, State objects protect the context from inconsistent internal state.

* State objects can be shared : If state objects have no instance variables and the state they represent is encoded in entirely in their type, then context can share a State object.

### **Implementaion**

Implimentation related issue to consider:

1. __Who defines the state transitions ?__ :
State pattern does not specify which participant defines the criteria for state transitions.  If the criteria are fixed then they can be implemented entirely in the Context.
2. __Creating and destroying state objects__ :  
	* if states are not known at runtime, and context change state infrequently then create states only when they are needed.
	* If state change occurs rapidly, and you want to avoid destroying states, because they may be needed again shortly, then create states ahead of time and never destroy them.

### **Example Code**

**Speed.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public enum Speed {
	OFF(0),
	LOW(1),
	MEDIUM(2),
	HIGH(3);
	
	private final int speed;
	
	Speed(int speed) {
		this.speed = speed;
	}
	
	public int getSpeedValue() {
		return speed;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**State.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public interface State {
	public Speed increaseSpeed();
	public Speed decreaseSpeed();
}
{% endhighlight %}

**HighSpeedState**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public class HighSpeedState implements State {

	@Override
	public Speed increaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.OFF;
	}

	@Override
	public Speed decreaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.MEDIUM;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**MediumSpeedState.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public class MediumSpeedState implements State {

	@Override
	public Speed increaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.HIGH;
	}

	@Override
	public Speed decreaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.LOW;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**LowSpeedState**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public class LowSpeedState implements State {

	@Override
	public Speed increaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.MEDIUM;
	}

	@Override
	public Speed decreaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.OFF;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**OffState.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public class OffState implements State {
	
	@Override
	public Speed increaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.LOW;
	}

	@Override
	public Speed decreaseSpeed() {
		return Speed.HIGH;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Regulator.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}

package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;
/*
 * This is Context class and responsible for State creation and destruction.
 */
public class Regulator {
	private State [] states = {new OffState(), new LowSpeedState(),new MediumSpeedState(), new HighSpeedState()};
	Speed currentSpeed; 
	
	public Regulator() {
		currentSpeed = Speed.OFF;
	}
	
	public void increaseSpeed() {
		currentSpeed = states[currentSpeed.getSpeedValue()].increaseSpeed();
		System.out.println("Current Speed :" + currentSpeed);
		
	}
	
	public void decreaseSpeed() {
		currentSpeed = states[currentSpeed.getSpeedValue()].decreaseSpeed();
		System.out.println("Current Speed :" + currentSpeed);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}


**StateDemo.java**

{% highlight java linenos %}
package com.designpatterns.behavioural.state;

public class StateDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Regulator regulator = new Regulator();
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //LOW
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //MEDIUM
		regulator.decreaseSpeed(); //LOW
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //MEDIUM
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //HIGH
		regulator.decreaseSpeed(); //MEDIUM
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //HIGH
		regulator.increaseSpeed(); //OFF		
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Output**

	Current Speed :LOW
	Current Speed :MEDIUM
	Current Speed :LOW
	Current Speed :MEDIUM
	Current Speed :HIGH
	Current Speed :MEDIUM
	Current Speed :HIGH
	Current Speed :OFF
